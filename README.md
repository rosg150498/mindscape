# Mindscape

## Project Goals and Target Audience

Welcome to Mindscape. Mindscape provides resources for people seeking help with underlying mental health conditions. It's primary focus is to reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues and promote mental health awareness and self-care practices. 

The aim of this site is to advise to those struggling that they are not alone and there is a place for them to gather to feel connected, safe, content, satisfied and emotionally stable. A contact form will be incorporated into the website to provide users with a means of confidentially expressing their thoughts and feelings. We aim to offer support and guidance to those in need and, in more serious cases, provide referrals to mental health specialists.

## Website Design Choices

## Colours

For the mental health supportive single page website appearance I will be employing a colour palette that I developed with some assistance from the website ("www.coolors.co.") When deciding on the colour scheme for the mental health supportive website, I considered how each choice would affect the overall feel, impression and presentation of the site. I also made use of the website (https://userway.org/contrast) to ensure the website has good color contrast and make content easier to read for people with visual impairments or color blindness. So, I went with a set of contrasting hues that thought would convey my message clearly to my target audience. So, I have decided to go with a bright green colour (#00B500) for the navigation bar and footer, this colour is a bright and vibrant shade of green that is often associated with growth, balance and harmony. Also known for often to represent health and wellness, it can help convey a sense of calm, balance, and stability, which can be important for individuals seeking information and resources for mental health support. Additionally, the colour green has been shown to have a soothing effect on the mind and body. I decided upon a black colour #FFFFFF for the navigation links and main body text of the web page to maintain a constrast and consistency, and is also easy to read and which is not straining to the eye for the user. I have also decided to use a sky blue colour shade (#87CEEB) for the background of the sections as this colour has a calming and soothing effect and could help create a peaceful and welcoming atmosphere for these sections, which may contain information and resources for individuals seeking help and support for their mental health concerns. When a user hovers over the navigation links it will change to white #FFFFFF for effectiveness. The contact form elements will have a colour shade of #FFB347 to highlight feedback for the users and draw attention. 


## Fonts

I experimented with a wide variety of fonts found on the Google Fonts website in order to find a typeface that I believe would be suitable for the single-page website that is dedicated to mental health support. As it is clean, inviting, and easy to read, the sans-serif typeface 'Open Sans' will serve as the primary body of the text I will be composing. It is also a font that works well for people who have dyslexia. Because of these properties, individuals are able to easily interpret the content and quickly navigate between the various sections of the website without encountering any difficulties. I have decided to use the Lato font family for the header, navigation, headings, and footer because it contrasts well and prevents excessive usage of the font type. This decision was based on the fact that Lato is a sans-serif font.

## Logo / Icons

When designing my mental health website, I will use icons from the flat icon website, which can be found at (https://www.flaticon.com/). I will use visual representations for each section of the website to ensure user-friendliness and assist individuals who suffer from mental health issues. For instance, I will represent the seeking help and treatment section with connected individuals to help users feel welcome, connected, and, most importantly, supported. I will ensure consistency throughout the single-page website by incorporating suitable icons for each section.

## Media Queries / Responsive Design

I used Balsamiq to create wireframe concepts while developing my single-page website for the Mindscape project. To enhance user experience, I initially focused on a mobile-first design and then scaled it up for tablet and desktop use. I am of the belief that a single-page design can effectively engage users and provide them with seamless access to supportive information through the use of a navigation bar, page scrolling, and a 'return to top' button. I implemented this functionality as part of my ongoing efforts to create a user-friendly interface that meets the needs of my visitors.
