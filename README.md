# Mindscape

## Project Goals and Target Audience

Welcome to Mindscape. Mindscape provides resources for people seeking help with underlying mental health conditions. It's primary focus is to reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues and promote mental health awareness and self-care practices. 

The aim of this site is to advise to those struggling that they are not alone and there is a place for them to gather to feel connected, safe, content, satisfied and emotionally stable. A contact form will be incorporated into the website to provide users with a means of confidentially expressing their thoughts and feelings. We aim to offer support and guidance to those in need and, in more serious cases, provide referrals to mental health specialists.
